## Tech

-   [`Svelte`](https://svelte.dev/) - CYBERNETICALLY ENHANCED WEB APPS
-   [`Phaser 3`](https://phaser.io/phaser3) - Phaser 3 is the next generation of the Phaser Game Framework. Every last element has been rebuilt from scratch using a fully modular structure, combined with a data-orientated approach. It includes a brand-new custom WebGL renderer designed specifically for the needs of modern 2D games.
-   [`svelte-phaser`](https://svelte-phaser.com/) - Create Phaser games with Svelte
-   [`tauri`](https://tauri.studio/) - Tauri is a toolkit that helps developers make applications for the major desktop platforms - using virtually any frontend framework. The core of Tauri is built with Rust, and the CLI leverages Node.js.

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open

# or as tauri project
yarn tauri dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn tauri build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.
